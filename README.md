WIP Game Launcher to act as an emulator for a console that does not exist. Fully optional, meant to give immersive experience to players playing MBB games. 
- Current plan is to create a 3D interface that simulates a retro console, similar to something like a PS2.
- Intended to support future MBB games which will all follow a cohesive, consistent aesthetic and appear as though they come from the same pseudo-console.
- Optional to add external games, simply create a folder in the Games folder with the title of the game along with a .xml file containing the information and an icon.png. (See example TestGame.xml for reference)
- Adding games along with tracking time already finished, simply follow above.
- Items in the Menu Strip are currently non-functional and are the current focus.
